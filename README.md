# 🎮 Amir Alishahi  

**Game Developer & Designer**  

I'm a passionate developer and designer with experience building games from the ground up, especially in startup environments and indie projects.  
I enjoy blending technical problem-solving with creative design to deliver engaging player experiences.  

Currently working on **Odysape Web Game **, an NFT Game  project where I focus on both gameplay design and technical development.
